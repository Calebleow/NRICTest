# NRICTest

An experiment to validate NRIC/FIN numbers using Telegram as the interface.

The only files that are required is the main.py file and the Telegram Bot API.

Run the command below to install the library in the folder with the rest of the files.

pip install python-telegram-bot

Run main.py
Once the bot is running, the bot can be contacted on telegram at @NRICTesterBot

Commits to this repo will notify me on Telegram as well.

Have fun with it. Stay safe.
